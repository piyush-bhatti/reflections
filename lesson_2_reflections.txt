What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git starts tracking file versions

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

It is an intermediate area to which you add the files from the working
directory that need to be in a commit before bundling them into a 
commit and sending to repository.
It helps us add only the needed files to a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Add the specific files you want to store in one commit to the staging
area and then commit with just those files in one commit

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

when you want to create a sligtly different version of the project, 
try out some experimental features. Working on a new branch will not 
change the code on the master branch and one can progress on both simultaneously
without having any interference from changes on the other

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams tell us the parent of each commit and show us commits without
a branch

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

A single commit now points to both branches, and incorporates the 
commits of both branches into one. Because it points to the tip of
both branches

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

Pros: less time consuming, we get all the commit history of both branches
Cons: might have overlaps from intuitive refactoring that git can't 
identify
