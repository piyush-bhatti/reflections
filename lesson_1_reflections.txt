How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It pointed out the lines that had changed from the previous version
    and narrowed our search radius

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    easier to correct mistakes, revert to previous versions, use earlier
    versions as template for similar projects

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: logical, meaningful
    cons: commits may be badly spaced, one might forget

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is programming projects oriented and docs is for individual 
    docs

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives a log of the commits in repository and git diff lets
    you compare the commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    reverting to previous versions or finding bugs including deleted
    lines is easier

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Version control
