When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with other people or sharing repository as open source

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes might create conflicts and it would interupt whatever
    one is currently working on. Instead updating manually can be done
    as necessary and at an appropriate time

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: Cloning on GitHub with a backlink to original
    CLones: An independant copy of a repository
    Branches: A versioin of the master that runs parallel to the master branch
    without interferece and shares commits uptil the point of divergence

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Allows to work offline. One can check the changes made in the online
    version without having to merge one's ongoing work with it.
